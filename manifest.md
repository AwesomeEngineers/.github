Have fun and let knowledge thrive.

- Who we are

A group of enthusiast engineers with endless motivation to learn, share and enjoy technologies.

- Goals
  - Have fun while learning and researching and implementing innovative technologies.
  - Generate quality content for the benefit of our peers.
  - Share knowledge among ourselves.

- Principles
  - There is nothing mandatory.
  - Everyone can propose ideas.
  - Every person will commit to the project as much as he/she wants, no more, no less.
  - Every member can work individually or in group in whatever they want, always trying to offer something to the ecosystem.
  - All engineering information is English based, code, issues, pull Requests, everything.
  - Everything must be automated as much as possible, even documentation.
  - Everything must be as standarized as possible.
  - All meaningful changes are integrated using the Pull Request flow (approval policies TBD).
  - All documentation should be clear, to the point and complete.
  - It's recommended to use diagrams to clarify flows, architectures and definitions.

- Tools
  - Planifications are done using Github Projects.
  - The SCM provider is Github.
  - All new ideas, tasks, features and bugs are managed using Github issues.
  - CI using Github actions (may change if integrated in the platform infrastructure)
  - The communication provider is Discord because of channels organized by topics, voice channels, screen sharing and also have API to develop bots.

- Workflow
  - All ideas and proposals are started by opening an issue in the main repository. In that issue every member can discuss and expose opinions, after that, if the idea is "accepted", should be defined: goal, next steps, opening issues in the planification board to start working on the idea.
  - Repositories will follow the trunk model with `main` as the long term branch. The `main` branch will will be the base of the feature and bug branches.
  - Versions will be defined through tags which will be associated to a release worflow in Github Actions.
