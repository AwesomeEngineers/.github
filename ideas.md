# Interesting technologies and ideas

## Ideas

An event-driven + serverless platform using:
  - Kubernetes (k3s, k3d, other providers)
  - Helm / Kustomize
  - ArgoCD
  - Canary / Rollout / Blue Green deployments
  - CloudEvents + json schemas + service registry
  - NATS (microservice communications) -> event driven
  - Serverless with OpenFaasS / Knative
  - Keda for event-based scaling
  - Golang development (polyglot microservices are accepted)

## Technologies

  - Linkerd for service mesh
  - Monitoring: Logs + Metrics + Tracing
  - Other topics: security and iam, governance, admission control (Kyverno) and policies
  - Distroless images
  - Goreleaser
  - Feature flags
  - Kubernetes controller / operator
